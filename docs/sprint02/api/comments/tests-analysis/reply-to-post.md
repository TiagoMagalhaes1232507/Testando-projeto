### Analysis
The test case "CTC13 - Reply To Post (Error - Invalid slug parameter)" aims to validate the API's behavior when a user attempts to reply to a post using an invalid slug parameter. This parameter is crucial for identifying the specific post to which the reply is intended.

**Input:**
- An invalid slug parameter, represented as "{invalidSlug}". This parameter is intentionally incorrect to test the API's handling of invalid inputs.

**Expected:**
- The API should respond with a 404 Not Found status code, indicating that the post with the provided slug could not be found.
- The error message should be "Couldn't find a post by slug {invalidSlug}". This message clearly conveys the reason for the 404 status code and provides the invalid slug value for context.

**Result:**
- The test passed (indicated by the status "Pass"). This means that the API returned the expected status code and response message when a invalid slug parameter was provided.

### Conclusion:
The test case passed as the API correctly returned a 404 Not Found status code and the appropriate error message when presented with an invalid slug parameter. This demonstrates that the API effectively handles invalid slug inputs and provides informative feedback to the user. The error message accurately identifies the issue and helps the user understand why their request failed.

### Analysis
The test checks if the API responds appropriately when the slug parameter is missing in a reply request.

**Input:**
- The request for a reply to a post is submitted without including the slug parameter.

**Expected:**
- The API should return a 400 Bad Request status code, indicating that the slug parameter is missing.
- The error message should be "Slug parameter must be provided" to clearly convey the reason for the 400 status code.

**Result:**
- The test failed (indicated by the status "Fail"). This means that the API did not return the expected status code and/or error message when the slug parameter was missing.
- Instead, the API unexpectedly returned a 500 Internal Server Error with the error message "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')".

### Conclusion
The test case failed as the API did not handle the missing slug parameter scenario correctly. Instead of returning a 400 Bad Request with a specific error message, the API encountered an internal server error. This indicates a potential bug in the API's logic for handling missing slug parameters and requires further investigation to identify and resolve the underlying issue.

## Test: [CTC016 - Reply To Post (Error - invalid token)](../../../../../src/automated-tests/comments/comments-tests2.spec.ts): 
should return status 401 and a correct message.

### Description
This test case evaluates the API's behavior when a reply to a post is attempted with an invalid authentication token. The test aims to verify that the API correctly handles invalid tokens and provides appropriate error messages.

### Analysis
The test checks if the API responds appropriately to a request containing an invalid token.

**Input:**
An invalid authentication token is included in the request header.

**Expected:**
- The API should return a 401 Unauthorized status code, indicating that the user is not authorized to perform the action.
- The error message should be "User authentication required" to clearly convey the reason for the 401 status code.

**Received:**
- The API unexpectedly returned a 403 Forbidden status code, indicating that the user is not permitted to access the resource.
- The error message was "Token signature expired", suggesting that the provided token has expired.

### Conclusion
The test failed as the API did not handle the invalid token scenario correctly. Instead of returning a 401 Unauthorized status code with a clear authentication error message, the API returned a 403 Forbidden status code and an expired token error message. This indicates a potential issue in the API's error handling for invalid tokens.

### Additional Notes:
- The 403 Forbidden status code is typically used when a user has valid authentication credentials but lacks the necessary permissions to perform a specific action. In this case, the error message "Token signature expired" suggests that the token is invalid due to expiration, rather than a permission issue.
- The API should be updated to correctly return a 401 Unauthorized status code with the appropriate error message when an authentication token is invalid. This will provide a more accurate and consistent user experience.

## Test: [CTC017 - Reply To Post (Error - Missing token)](../../../../../src/automated-tests/comments/comments-tests2.spec.ts): 
should return status 401 and a correct message.

### Description
This test case evaluates the API's behavior when a user attempts to reply to a post without providing an authentication token.

### Analysis
The test checks if the API correctly responds to a request missing the required authentication token.

**Input:**
- A request to reply to a post is sent without an authentication token.

**Expected:**
- The API should return a 401 Unauthorized status code, indicating that the user is not authorized to perform the action.
- The error message should be "User authentication required".

**Received:**
- The test failed (indicated by the status "Fail"). This means that the API did not return the expected status code and/or error message.
- Instead, the API returned a 403 Forbidden status code with the error message "No access token provided".

### Conclusion
The test case failed as the API did not handle the missing authentication token scenario as expected. Instead of returning a 401 Unauthorized with a clear message, the API returned a 403 Forbidden, which typically indicates permission-related issues. This suggests a potential error in the API's logic for handling missing tokens and error codes. 

### Additional Notes:
- The 401 Unauthorized status code is specifically intended for authentication failures, while 403 Forbidden is generally used for permission-related issues.
- The error message "User authentication required" is more informative and accurately conveys the reason for the failure.
- The API should be updated to correctly return a 401 Unauthorized status code with the appropriate error message when an authentication token is missing. This will provide a more accurate and consistent user experience.
