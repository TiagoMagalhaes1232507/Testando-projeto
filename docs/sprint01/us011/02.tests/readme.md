# US 0011 - To logout

# 1. Tests 

**Test AC1:** Check if the user is logged into the application.

To log out, the user must be logged in. Otherwise, instead of the button saying "logout", it should say "join".



**Test 2:** Verify that clicking the logout button indeed logs the user out.

When the user clicks the logout button, they should be logged out of the application, and the button should change to "join". The user should no longer be able to create new posts, but they should still be able to view other posts.
