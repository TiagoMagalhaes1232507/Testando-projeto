# US 008 - To vote on a Discussion

# 1. Tests 

**Test-AC1:** When a user goes to a list of discussions, they should see a button to vote on each discussion.

**Test-AC2:** When a user clicks the vote button on a discussion, the system should record their vote. The vote count should change to show that the user has voted.

**Test-AC3:** Each discussion on the list should show how many votes it has received.

**Test-AC4:** Users should be able to change their vote on a discussion at any time. If they change their vote, the vote count should update. The button or the vote count may also change to reflect the new vote.

**Test-AC5:** Users should only be able to vote on a discussion once. If they try to vote again, the system will not allow them to submit a second vote.



*Test cases for AC6 (viewing voters) and AC7 (preventing voting on own discussion) are considered additional functionalities They are not part of the core acceptance criteria, and are not included here.*
