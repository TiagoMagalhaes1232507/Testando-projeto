    * Resource Utilization: The application is efficiently utilizing system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to support core functionalities effectively. This ensures the application can handle expected usage without wasting resources.
    * Horizontal Scalability: The application should be designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers as the user base and discussions grow. This allows the system to accommodate increased demands for resources without impacting performance.



## Supportability

* no clear non-functionality verified in this topic.
* Suggestion:
    * Scalability: The system is able to handle a large and growing user base without performance degradation.
